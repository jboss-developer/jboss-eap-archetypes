JBoss Archetypes Contributing Guide
===================================

Archetype is a Maven project templating toolkit

Basic Steps
-----------

To contribute to the Archetypes, fork the Archetypes repository to your own Git, clone your fork, commit your work on topic branches, and make pull requests. 

If you don't have the Git client (`git`), get it from: <http://git-scm.com/>

Here are the steps in detail:

1. [Fork](https://github.com/jboss-jdf/jboss-as-archetype/fork_select) the project. This creates a the project in your own Git.

2. Clone your fork. This creates a directory in your local file system.

        git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/jboss-as-archetype.git

3. Add the remote `upstream` repository.

        git remote add upstream git@github.com:jboss-jdf/jboss-as-archetype.git

4. Get the latest files from the `upstream` repository.

        git fetch upstream

5. Create a new topic branch to contain your features, changes, or fixes.

        git checkout -b <topic-branch-name> upstream/master

6. Contribute new code or make changes to existing files. Make sure that you follow the General Guidelines below.

7. Build the archetypes and install them into your Maven repository.

        mvn clean install


7. Test the changes using Maven.

    1. Navigate to the root of the archetype with the code changes and run `mvn test`.
    2. The project is created in the `target/` directory of the archteype.
    3. Verify the generated project builds and runs as expected.

8. Test the changes using JBoss Developer Studio.

    1. In JDBS, choose File` --> `New` --> `Maven Project` and click `Next`.
    2. Select the Project Name and Location. Do NOT check `Create a simple project (skip archetype selection)`. Click `Next`.
    3. Choose catalog `Default Local` and check `Include snapshot archetypes`. Select your modified archetype snapshot and click `Next`.
    4. Enter the groupId, artifactId, and other information, then click 'Finish'.
    3. Verify the generated project builds and runs as expected.

8. Commit your changes to your local topic branch. You must use `git add filename` for every file you create or change.

        git add <changed-filename>
        git commit -m `Description of change...`

9. Push your local topic branch to your github forked repository. This will create a branch on your Git fork repository with the same name as your local topic branch name.

        git push origin HEAD            

10. Browse to the <topic-branch-name> branch on your forked Git repository and [open a Pull Request](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/). Give it a clear title and description.

General Guidelines
------------------

* We strongly encourage you to discuss your planned archetype on the [dev list](http://www.jboss.org/jdf/forums/jdf-dev/) before starting.

* The archetype should be formatted using the JBoss AS profiles found at <https://github.com/jboss/ide-configs/tree/master/ide-configs>

* More instructions, see the [Guide to Creating Archetypes](http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-creating-archetypes.html)
