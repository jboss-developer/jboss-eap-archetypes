JBoss Archetypes Contributing Guide
===================================

Archetype is a Maven project templating toolkit

Basic Steps
-----------

To contribute Archetypes, fork the main Archetypes repository, clone your fork, commit your work on topic branches and make pull requests.

Here are the steps:

1. [Fork](https://github.com/jboss-jdf/jboss-as-archetype/fork_select) the project.

2. Clone your fork (`git@github.com:<your-username>/jboss-as-archetype.git`).

3. Add an `upstream` remote (`git remote add upstream git@github.com:jboss-jdf/jboss-as-archetype.git`).

4. Get the latest changes from upstream (e.g. `git pull upstream master`).

5. Create a new topic branch to contain your feature, change, or fix (`git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>`).

6. Make sure that your changes follow the General Guidelines below.

7. Commit your changes to your topic branch.

8. Push your topic branch up to your fork (`git push origin  <topic-branch-name>`).

9. [Open a Pull Request](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/) with a clear title and description.

If you don't have the Git client (`git`), get it from: <http://git-scm.com/>

General Guidelines
------------------

* We strongly encourage you to discuss your planned archetype on the [dev list](http://www.jboss.org/jdf/forums/jdf-dev/) before starting.

* The archetype should be formatted using the JBoss AS profiles found at <https://github.com/jboss/ide-configs/tree/master/ide-configs>

* More instructions, see the [Guide to Creating Archetypes](http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-creating-archetypes.html)
